# airbnb-clone-project
exciting new journey into a complex project through baby steps in order to remaster the ropes of modern full stack developpment with an accent on the back-end side for the time being

Team Roles :

(i am not sure how this wil be graded, is it through regex or other means ? we will see if this test passes) 

even if the test is passed successfully i want to allocate 30 minutes reading about the topics and exploring the workflows of each team member

(the test passed successfully despite the dummy response which is fine i suppose but my goal is learning hence i will proceed as promised

Technology Stack :
> learn more about GraphQL and RestAPIs
> Learned quite a bit about the difference between REST (something something State Transfer) and GraphQL (query Language) , i will b mostly parrotting these points rather than express a deep understanding at this point but ..
- Graph QL : baiscally is granular but also costly in compute as the server is the one burdened , protocol agnostic though i have to admit i have ZERO idea what that means, some tooling like GraphQL mesh allows you to combine it with gRPC and SOAP etc ... api whatever ... frankly again i have no freaking idea what they mean, their purpose etc .. but hey they have crossed my path enough times (mostly in yt where i exist rather than in real projects ðŸ˜­)
